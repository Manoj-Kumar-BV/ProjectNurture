# 🎮 ProjectNurture - PC Compatibility Complete! 

## ✅ What Was Done

I've successfully converted your VR farming game to support **both VR and PC** modes! Here's what I created:

### 📝 **7 New Scripts**
1. **PCInputManager.cs** - Automatically detects VR vs PC and switches modes
2. **PCPlayerController.cs** - First-person movement (WASD + Mouse)
3. **PCInteractionController.cs** - Click to grab/use objects
4. **PCToolController.cs** - Makes tools work with keyboard/mouse
5. **PCUIController.cs** - Makes UI clickable with mouse
6. **PCGrabbableAdapter.cs** - Compatibility for VR/PC switching
7. **PCSetupHelper.cs** - Automated setup tool

### 🔧 **1 Modified Script**
- **HarvestScript.cs** - Now works in both VR and PC modes

### 📚 **5 Documentation Files**
1. **PC_CONTROLS_SETUP.md** - Complete setup guide (detailed)
2. **PC_SETUP_CHECKLIST.md** - Step-by-step checklist
3. **PC_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md** - Technical overview
4. **PC_VISUAL_GUIDE.md** - Visual diagrams and flowcharts
5. **README.md** - Updated with PC controls

## 🎯 PC Controls

### Movement
- **WASD** - Walk around
- **Mouse** - Look around
- **Shift** - Run
- **Space** - Jump
- **ESC** - Show/hide cursor

### Interaction
- **Left Click** - Pick up / Drop objects
- **Right Click (Hold)** - Use tools
  - With Spade: Dig soil
  - With Watering Can: Pour water

## 🚀 How to Set It Up

### Quick Setup (Easiest)
1. In Unity, create an empty GameObject
2. Add the `PCSetupHelper` script to it
3. Right-click the component → **Auto Setup PC Controls**
4. Follow the prompts in the console
5. Test it out!

### Manual Setup
Follow the detailed checklist in **PC_SETUP_CHECKLIST.md**

## 🎮 How It Works

### Automatic Mode Detection
The game automatically detects if a VR headset is connected:
- **VR Headset Connected** → Uses original VR controls
- **No VR Headset** → Uses keyboard & mouse

You can also manually force PC or VR mode in the InputManager.

### What Players Experience

**VR Mode (Original)**
- Natural hand interactions
- Physical tool movements
- Teleportation
- Room-scale experience

**PC Mode (New!)**
- Standard gaming controls
- Point-and-click interaction
- FPS-style movement
- Mouse precision

## 📋 What You Need to Do

### 1. Copy Scripts
All scripts are in: `Assets/Scripts/`
- PCInputManager.cs
- PCPlayerController.cs
- PCInteractionController.cs
- PCToolController.cs
- PCUIController.cs
- PCGrabbableAdapter.cs
- PCSetupHelper.cs
- HarvestScript.cs (modified)

### 2. Scene Setup
You need to:
1. Create a **PCPlayer** GameObject (or use auto-setup)
2. Create an **InputManager** GameObject (or use auto-setup)
3. Add **tags** to your objects (Spade, WateringCan, Seed, Soil, Harvestable)
4. Add **"Interactable" layer** and assign to grabbable objects
5. Create **UI elements** (crosshair, interaction prompt)

**The PCSetupHelper can do most of this automatically!**

### 3. Object Configuration
For each tool/interactable object:
- ✅ Add appropriate tag
- ✅ Set layer to "Interactable"
- ✅ Ensure it has a Collider
- ✅ Ensure it has a Rigidbody (for physics objects)

2. Select **PC, Mac & Linux Standalone**
3. Platform: **Windows**
4. Architecture: **x86_64**
5. Add your Main scene
6. Click **Build**

## ✨ Key Features

### ✅ What Works
- Walking and running (WASD + Shift)
- Looking around (Mouse)
- Picking up tools and objects (Left Click)
- Using spade to dig (Right Click)
- Pouring water from watering can (Right Click)
- Planting seeds
- Harvesting plants
- Quiz interaction
- Full gameplay loop

### 🎯 Compatibility

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Can't move?
- Press ESC to lock cursor
- Check PCPlayerController is enabled

### Can't pick up objects?
- Check object has correct tag
- Check object is on "Interactable" layer
- Check you're close enough (default 3 meters)

### Tools not working?
- Hold RIGHT mouse button (not left)
- Make sure you're holding the tool
- Look at the target (soil, plants, etc.)

### Still in VR mode?
- Disconnect VR headset
- Or manually set to PC mode in InputManager
