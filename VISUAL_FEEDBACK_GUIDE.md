# 🎨 Enhanced Visual Feedback System - Summary

## ✅ What I Just Added

I've **upgraded your interaction system** to make it super clear and easy to demonstrate! Here's what's new:

## 🎯 NEW VISUAL FEEDBACK

### 1. **Color-Coded Highlights**

**GREEN HIGHLIGHT** = Can Pick Up
- Spade
- Watering Can
- Seeds
- Harvestable Vegetables

**YELLOW HIGHLIGHT** = Can Use Tool Here
- Soil (when you need to dig or water)

### 2. **Clear Text Instructions**

The text at bottom of screen now shows:
- 🔧 **Icon + Action** - Easy to understand
- **What to press** - [LEFT CLICK] or [RIGHT CLICK]
- **What it does** - "Pick up SPADE (Used to dig soil)"

### 3. **Context-Aware Messages**

**When looking at spade:**
```
🔧 [LEFT CLICK] Pick up SPADE
(Used to dig soil and cover seeds)
```

**When holding spade and looking at soil:**
```
⛏️ [HOLD RIGHT CLICK] DIG with Spade
[LEFT CLICK] Drop Spade
```
